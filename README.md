# Trade-Analysis

Attention: The notebook that accompanies this project exhibits a high level of technical debt. As I gathered the data and tried new things the workbook became increasingly complex. As this analysis is for personal use I did not mind going back to clean the code and make sure the workbook would run. The datasets used in this book can be downloaded from the IMF and Observatory of Economic Complexity. However, the data from the Observatory is at the product level and as such is very large, at least for my personal computer. It is around 220 million rows and took as much as 30GB on disk, even with data optimization pandas struggled to read and perform computations. I created a postgresql database and performed the aggregations there. 


DESCRIPTION: 

This project explores the evolving export trends of the world’s five largest exporting nations—China, Germany, the USA, the Netherlands, and Japan—using IMF trade data from 2016 to 2023. Through data analysis and visualization techniques, I examine shifts in global trade patterns, identifying key insights in export dominance.
Using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib, I transformed raw economic data into meaningful visual narratives.  The project delves into year-over-year export fluctuations, comparative country analysis, and trend projections, offering valuable insights into the global trade ecosystem

KEY FEATURES OF THIS PROJECT:
- Data Acquisition & Cleaning: Imported IMF export data and preprocessed it for analysis, ensuring accuracy and consistency.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigated statistical trends, and economic patterns across the five leading exporters.
- Data Visualization: Developed visualizations using Matplotlib to present key export insights.
- Comparative Country Analysis: Compared export performance across different nations, identifying dominant players.

SKILLS USED IN THIS PROJECT:
- Data Analysis & Processing: Cleaning, filtering, and transforming complex trade datasets for deeper insights.
- Pandas & NumPy: Performing efficient data manipulation, statistical calculations, and structuring information for visualization.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: Designing compelling charts to make trade trends more accessible.
- Economic & Trade Knowledge: Understanding key drivers of export fluctuations and global trade behavior.
- Trend Forecasting: Analyzing past patterns to infer possible future shifts in global exports.
- Project Documentation & Presentation: Organizing findings into a structured format for professional review and public sharing.
